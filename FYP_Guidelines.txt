Marks awarded by the project supervisor and second marker for the quality of the end product and the candidate's total technical achievement.

In the unlikely event that the project does not involve the creation of a significant piece of software then an appropriate scheme will be used to allocate an end product grade to other forms of deliverable such as hardware.

If there is no evidence of frequent updates to your department GitLab repository of program code then a mark of zero will be awarded for your end product.

Does it work? Is it stable?

Is the software usable? Is the interface appropriate for the application (a compiler might require more technical skills to run than an e-commerce site)?

Does the code and system structure follow the design?

How complete is the functionality with respect to the requirements?

Is the coding clean and well documented?

Does the GitLab repository reflect the use of good software engineering principles including appropriate use of branches/tags?

Does the product require techniques, tools, theory or concepts which are clearly above second year level?

Does the product use complex new technologies/platforms or require the study of a significant body of literature from disparate sources to complete?

Marks awarded by the supervisor for the ability of the student to plan and organise their project as a professional. This score reflects the students ability to recognise and follow appropriate professional behaviour.

If there is no evidence of frequent, reflective updates to your work diary then a mark of zero will be awarded for your professionalism.

You are evaluated on:

the ability to attend supervisory meetings;

the ability to alter their project plan and identify priorities as they arise;

the ability to keep an organised project diary;

the ability to maintain a consistently high level of effort throughout the project;

an assessment of whether the student can work independently or requires constant supervisory intervention;

communicate well, understanding relevant professional issues, and maintain a good professional working attitude towards the project
